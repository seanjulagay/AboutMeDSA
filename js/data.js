    "Hello, I'm Sean! I made this little webpage to tell you more about myself! Here's 5 random facts about me.",
    "1. I love music. I enjoy listening to different genres such as soul, jazz, and pop. I also play the guitar, and I'm currently an active member and officer of the Lasallian Pop Band. One day, I hope to release my own music.",
    "2. I also love coding. Whether it's frontend or backend, I try my best to study and improve at both stacks so I'll become a better programmer in the future. I aim to become a fullstack developer in the future.",
    "3. I enjoy gaming in my spare time. I like playing open-world and simulation games and explore the world right from behind my monitor. Despite me being an introvert in real life, I can be an extrovert in these games.",
    "4. I can solve a Rubik's cube in 30 seconds on average. I used to be a hardcore wannabe speedcuber to impress someone I liked back in junior high. While I don't really like cubing anymore, it's a neat party trick.",
    "5. I am an advocate for self-improvement. While I'm not quite good at it, I try to make sure that I incorporate proper organization and efficiency in my daily life. College classes help me strive towards my goal.",
    "That's all! Thank you for viewing my page! I look forward to learning a lot from this class, and I hope that everyone of us gets high grades! See you in the online classroom! :)"
